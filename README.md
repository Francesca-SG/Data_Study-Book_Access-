# Data_Study-Book_Access-


### Methodology
"Objective:
Measure the access to physical books in each US State, ranking them by the total number of libraries and bookstores per 100k population. 

##### Data Sources:
US Population per State: U.S. Census Bureau, 2023 population estimates
Libraries: Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), PLS Benchmarking Tables, 2023
Bookstores: U.S. Census Bureau, County Business Patterns (NAICS 451211), 2023

##### Approach:
Population estimates, number of libraries and number of bookstores data, were collected from official govermental sources and sorted by US State. 

The total number of libraries and bookstores was divided by 100000  to get the number of libraries and bookstores per 100k population.

States were then ranked from highest to lowest based on the total number of libraries and bookstores per 100k population. Reflecting the density of access to physical books at fixed locations in each state.

##### Limitations:
-This study only measures fixed physical locations the public can visit, bookmobiles have been excluded as they do not operate from a single fixed location.
-Data reflects availability , not quality or size of location.
-FY 2023 is the most recent available data for library and bookstore totals. For consistency 2023 population estimates were used, resulting in a more accurate analysis.
